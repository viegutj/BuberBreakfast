# BuberBreakfast
REST WebAPI I made in .NET 6.0 using C# and the error management package ErrorOr. This project challenged my C# server skills and taught me how to use a new package. I referenced FreeCodeCamp's tutorial video and made the repo from scratch.

POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE breakfasts from this API using JSON formatting. This is only the backend; no react frontend is present.
